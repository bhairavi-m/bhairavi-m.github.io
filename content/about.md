## Hi!👋🏽

 I am currently pursuing the MSE in Data Science program at the University of Pennsylvania. I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Mathematics and Statistics and I am passionate about Data, Ethics, Policy and Social Impact. I am eager about working on Machine Learning algorithms that would avoid undesirable biases, promote people's best interests, be open to introspection, and aim towards building AI that behaves in a socially responsible way.

## Interests📝

Recently looking to gain a comprehensive grasp of Quantitative Social Science methods in a well-structured program with unmatchable rigor. I want to take up AI projects that deal with social impact in a fair and equitable manner. In the long term, I would like to be involved in roles where I can utilize my Data Science skills to develop innovative solutions for Social Good.

## Hobbies ✨

I enjoy salsa dancing💃🏻, art and crafts🎨, trekking⛰️ and baking🍰! I play the guitar, and recently cleared the Trinity Grade 4: Rock n Pop Exam with merit🎸
