## Hi!👋🏽

 I am currently pursuing the MSE in Data Science program at the University of Pennsylvania. I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Mathematics and Statistics and I am passionate about Data, Ethics, Policy and Social Impact. I am particularly ecstatic about working on Machine Learning algorithms that would avoid undesirable biases, promote people's best interests, be open to introspection, and aim towards building AI that behaves in a socially responsible way.

#### I am all about talking and sharing! Reach out to me to discuss anything Math, ML or just to say hi?
