I worked on creating a modular feature transformation library for transforming data in Python and conducted extensive research on Machine Learning. This included optimizing MLOps workflow to enable an easy transition from model development to inference for production environments. I not only learned how to use existing AutoML tools like Dataiku, but also used various libraries in the Python Data Science ecosystem (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch - to name a few) for developing software at a professional level. Working in a collaborative environment helped me develop critical programming skills; using version control systems like GitLab highlighted the importance of good coding practices, building documentation using the sphinx library taught me the value of well-documented work, and conducting unit-tests using the pytest library maintained an agile process while establishing code standards across the development team. Additionally, I used tools that support the Data Science pipeline like Weights and Biases - an ML experiment tracking platform, to create benchmarks of different Machine Learning experiments, which aided in streamlining model debugging and tuning.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Data Analysis</title><link>/experience/data/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/experience/data/</guid><description>Prior to joining the AutoML team at iQGateway, I initially worked on analyzing students' performance through data generated by a Technology-Enabled Social Learning Platform (EdTech) for a client, one of India&amp;rsquo;s leading IT service organizations.

The preliminary Descriptive Analysis involved data cleansing, binning, and extracting data to inference tables, leading to the formation of detailed reports that contained high-value actionable insights and data visualizations.</description><content>&lt;p>Prior to joining the AutoML team at iQGateway, I initially worked on analyzing students' performance through data generated by a Technology-Enabled Social Learning Platform (EdTech) for a client, one of India&amp;rsquo;s leading IT service organizations.

The preliminary Descriptive Analysis involved data cleansing, binning, and extracting data to inference tables, leading to the formation of detailed reports that contained high-value actionable insights and data visualizations. Performing further Exploratory Data Analysis helped me understand Business Process Models and Notations, which enabled efficient information extraction from the various entity relationships. I became adept at using MS Excel to pivot the data, making it fit for analysis. Lastly, the Inferential Analysis led to reports used as nomination collaterals for awards by the client. A notable recognition of this work was evidenced when the client won the coveted Outstanding HR initiative Award at the 2020 Global Business Excellence Awards.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Social Impact</title><link>/experience/social/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/experience/social/</guid><description>Coming from a country where abject poverty is an overwhelming part of your daily life, it is difficult not to realize the privilege of having a family with stable financial means. This disheartening reality imbibed a sense of responsibility toward restoring some sort of parity. I truly believe that education has the power to break intergenerational cycles of poverty; it empowers individuals, promotes healthier lives, and boosts economic growth. I thus volunteered as a Mathematics teacher for children between the ages of 7-12 at the Center for Social Action (an organization in Christ University) during my undergraduate studies.</description><content>&lt;p>Coming from a country where abject poverty is an overwhelming part of your daily life, it is difficult not to realize the privilege of having a family with stable financial means. This disheartening reality imbibed a sense of responsibility toward restoring some sort of parity. I truly believe that education has the power to break intergenerational cycles of poverty; it empowers individuals, promotes healthier lives, and boosts economic growth. I thus volunteered as a Mathematics teacher for children between the ages of 7-12 at the Center for Social Action (an organization in Christ University) during my undergraduate studies. I believe I have the resources to unleash my potential, and thus it has been my goal to leverage my education and knowledge for the benefit of others. Being at the forefront of the digital revolution, it is exciting that I get to use technology for social welfare, to analyze and develop policies that efficiently provide the destitute section of our society the means to lead a better life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the winter fest organized by the Center for Social Action in December 2018, I met Shveta Raina, who founded Talerang, a career training company working towards creating a work-ready India. Talerang’s formal research began when Shveta was a student at Harvard Business School. Her analysis of India’s best colleges found that under 60% of students felt ready to take on a job, and less than 50% of students had mentors they could seek out, this was flagged as a work-readiness crisis, and the company set out to tackle the issue. I joined Talerang as a Web Design Intern and redesigned Talerang’s Online Portal by restructuring content while understanding User Experience principles which improved content engagement by 7%. I enjoyed meeting with the students mentored by Talerang and conducting their flagship Future CEOs program. Additionally, I was appointed as President of the Bangalore City Chapter, as a result of which I hosted multiple career fairs where I honed my leadership skills and connected with people from different backgrounds. This experience helped me recognize and appreciate the vital impact of today’s youth while constantly engaging with the community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During my time as a Chapter President, I was left with a feeling of immense satisfaction at the end of every day. It gave my life a more defined purpose, and I woke up with a rush of excitement to do better. I acknowledge that bringing about change and making a social impact takes compounded effort and commitment along with time, and the wins are few and far between. I found the small steps we took rewarding, and I will keep pushing for them as the only way to rise above.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
